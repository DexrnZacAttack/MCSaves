HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
1. Take screenshots, we recommend a screenshot of the world in the Worlds menu and a screenshot from within the world.
2. Grab the world files (in their original state, do not decompress them!!!)
3. Place the world files and a README, in a folder named after the world, with a subfolder (named Screenshots) inside said world folder containing screenshots.
4. Within that README, add screenshots (using paths from within the screenshots folder), your GitHub username, World name, platform, and version it was created on. 
There is a template for said readme in the repo root.
