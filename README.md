# MCSaves
This repo is meant to contain saves from all versions of Minecraft.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
1. Take screenshots, we recommend a screenshot of the world in the Worlds menu and a screenshot from within the world.
2. Grab the world files (Do not decompress, unless you're willing to put both the decompressed and compressed world in the same folder, or if the world is already pre-decompressed)
- Note: For Xbox 360 Edition, if possible, include the .bin file... you **must** remove your console, profile, and device id and other info from it, using a tool like Horizon.
- Additionally, if you see a `.EXT` or `THUMBS` file, please include it... It contains the world seed and other info.
3. Place the world files and a README in a folder named after the world, with a subfolder (named Screenshots) inside said world folder containing screenshots.
4. Within that README, add the screenshots you've put into the Screenshots folder, your GitHub username, World name, platform, and version it was created on. 
Here is a [template](template.md) for said README.
