# MCSaves
This repo is meant to contain saves from all versions of Minecraft.

# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
### 1. Take screenshots, we recommend a screenshot of the world in the Worlds menu and a screenshot from within the world.
### 2. Grab the world files (in their original state, do not decompress them!!!)
### 3. Place the world files and a README, in a folder named after the world, with a subfolder (named Screenshots) inside said world folder containing screenshots.
### 4. Within that README, add screenshots (using paths from within the screenshots folder), your GitHub username, World name, platform, and version it was created on. 
### Here is a [template](template.md) for said README.
